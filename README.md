# BountyHunter
(End of Life: December 2020)

This is a game that I started making in July 2018, learning Unity and C# programming. 

This is a repository for that game. I am rebooting this project and will start working on it again. 

Here goes my second game. 

-- May 2019

		This game is no longer under development. It started off as a tutorial that I took on a tangent. While I have a shit tonne of ideas about
		how I can improve this and add more to this, I think this is not the only game I will work on so this is the end for this game.

		Hella fun working on this, quite proud of the shape it is in today compared to what it was at the start of the year. But I need to work on more projects. If you wanna check it out, find it on mushahroomali.itch.io.

		Cheers!
